      "The rate of heat transfer is proportional to the temperature difference"
    ],
    "explanation":
        "Bernoulli's Principle explains how an airplane's wing generates lift. The curved shape of the wing (airfoil) forces the air above it to travel faster, creating a low-pressure zone, while the slower-moving air below creates a high-pressure zone, pushing the wing up."
