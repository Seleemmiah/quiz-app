    "correct_answer": "Gravity",
    "incorrect_answers": [
      "Weak Nuclear Force",
      "Electromagnetism",
      "Strong Nuclear Force"
    ],
    "explanation":
        "Despite its obvious effects on a large scale (like holding planets in orbit), gravity is by far the weakest of the four fundamental forces. A simple refrigerator magnet (electromagnetism) can overcome the entire gravitational pull of the Earth to pick up a paperclip."

    "question": "What is 'potential energy'?",
    "correct_answer":
        "The energy stored in an object due to its position or arrangement",
    "incorrect_answers": [
      "The energy of a moving object",
      "The energy stored in a battery",
      "The energy from the sun"
    ],
    "explanation":
        "Potential energy is stored energy. A common example is gravitational potential energy: a book held high in the air has potential energy. If you let it go, that potential energy is converted into kinetic energy (energy of motion) as it falls."

    "correct_answer":
        "The concept that all matter exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties",
    "incorrect_answers": [
      "The idea that waves and particles are opposites",
      "A particle that is made of a wave",
      "The theory that sound travels in waves"
    ],
    "explanation":
        "A central concept of quantum mechanics, wave-particle duality describes how quantum entities like photons and electrons can be described as *both* particles (with a specific location) and waves (spread out in space) depending on how they are measured."

    "incorrect_answers": [
      "Approximately 300,000,000 miles per hour",
      "Approximately 343 meters per second",
      "It is infinitely fast"
    ],
    "explanation":
        "The speed of light in a vacuum, commonly denoted as 'c', is a universal constant. Its exact value is 299,792,458 meters per second. 343 m/s is the approximate speed of sound in air."

    "correct_answer":
        "The buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces",
    "incorrect_answers": [
      "Give me a lever long enough, and I shall move the world",
      "The shortest distance between two points is a straight line",
      "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction"
    ],
    "explanation":
        "Archimedes' Principle explains buoyancy. It states that any body completely or partially submerged in a fluid (gas or liquid) at rest is acted upon by an upward, or buoyant, force. This is why a massive steel ship can float."
